# Projet-5-CountOnMe

The 5th project was an opportunity to study units tests, by developing CountOnMe's application, which is a calculator.

To succes the project, there remained some tasks to be done, such as: design in the Xcode project, implementing the project architecture in MVC, integrating division and multiplication and finally, it remained to include units tests .

To do this activity, I mainly got information from [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4729291-debuguez-et-testez-vos-applications-ios), [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/3530-testing-in-ios), and I received advices from my mentor of OpenClassroom and also from my partner, who is himself an iOS developper.
